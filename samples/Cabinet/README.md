# Cabinet example
**Note: This sample is a work in progress. It currently is just a post with a slot cut on the top and bottom**
This is an example project that generates a `*.scad` file that can be rendered in OpenSCAD. A powershell script is provided that can be used to set up a development environment using VSCode, `dotnet watch`, and OpenSCAD to provide a live update of the rendering as the source project is edited.
